This is a small project whose purpose is to learn the basics of the astropy library of python. The objective is to calculate the barycentric coordinates of the planets of the solar system at any instant of time using ephemerides. The "analysis" file contains an introduction to the problem posed and the program developed to carry out the calculations. The "program" file contains the program that has been developed.

The program has been prepared in Spanish

If you do not have the "astropy" library downloaded, you can consult the following link which indicates how to do so:
